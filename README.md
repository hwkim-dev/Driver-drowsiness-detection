# Driver-drowsiness-detection
YOLOv8 Driver drowsiness detection Deep learning project Enhanced by algorithm based on Facial Features  
  
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
  
# purpose
Receive driver's eye status data using a YOLOv8 model. If the eyes are closed for 70% of frames within a 4.5-second window, trigger a sound alarm. If the eyes are open for 0.5 seconds, turn off the alarm and consider it not drowsy.  
  
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
  
# operating principle
In Main.py, create and run four multiprocesses via multiprocessing:
 * Drowsiness detection algorithm
 * FPS and time calculation algorithm
 * OpenCV and model inference algorithm
 * process infrenced result and show true imshow function
Control these processes through a GUI.
